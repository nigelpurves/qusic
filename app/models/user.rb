    (user && user.salt == cookie_salt) ? user : nil   # ...then verifies that the salt stored in the cookie is the correct one for that user
  end
  
  # the code immediately above is idiomattically correct, however in functionality terms we could have written something else that more closely mirrors the method above that:
  # def self.authenticate.with.salt(id, cookie_salt)
  #   user = find_by_id(id)
  #   return nil  if user.nil?
  #   return user if user.salt == cookie_salt
  # end
  #
  # typical code in programming is: 
  # if boolean? 
  #   do_one_thing 
  # else 
  #   do_something_else 
  # end
  #
  # Ruby, like many languages allows you to shorten this using the ternary operator into:
  # boolean? ? do_one_thing : do_something_else
  #
  # in both cases the method returns the user if user is not nil and the user salt matches the cookie's salt; otherwise it returns nil. 
  # But the version immediately above is more idiomatically correct so we have used this as the method above
  #
  # You can also use the ternary operator to change:
  # if boolean?
  #   var = foo
  # else
  #   var = bar
  # end
  #
  # into:
  # var = boolean? ? foo : bar
  
  private # inside a Ruby class, all methods defined after private are used internally by the object & are not intended for public use.  Note also the extra indentation (not necessary but can be v helpful)
